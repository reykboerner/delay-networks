# Delay master stability of inertial oscillator networks
An analytical approach to investigate how delays affect the stability of synchronized oscillators on complex networks.

This repository bundles work developed in the context of my bachelor's [thesis](https://github.com/reykboerner/delay-networks/blob/master/boerner_BA-thesis.pdf), entitled *Master Stability of Inertial Oscillator Networks with Delay - An analytical approach applied to renewable power grids*.

### Where to start
* **Essentials.** Read the [**paper**](https://github.com/reykboerner/delay-networks/blob/master/boerner_BA-thesis.pdf) for a good overview of the key points, condensed to 4 pages.
* **Complete edition.** Dive into the [**thesis**](https://github.com/reykboerner/delay-networks/blob/master/boerner_BA-thesis.pdf) for an in-depth treatment on 40 pages, featuring theoretical background, derivations, simulations, and more. [How to read this thesis](howtoread).
* **Extended version.** If you're still hungry for more, take a look at the collection of [**supplemental figures**](supplemetal-figs) as well as the [**code**](code) used for simulations and computations of delay master stability functions.
