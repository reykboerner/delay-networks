# Stability of delayed oscillator networks
An analytical approach to investigate how delays affect the stability of synchronized oscillators on complex networks.

This repository bundles work developed in the context of my bachelor's [thesis](https://github.com/reykboerner/delay-networks/blob/master/boerner_BA-thesis.pdf) entitled *Master Stability of Inertial Oscillator Networks with Delay -- An analytical approach applied to renewable power grids*.
