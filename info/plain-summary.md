# To synchronize or not to synchronize: Exact stability conditions in networks with delay

Interactions in the real world often occur with a time delay that may influence how a complex system behaves.  In this article, we present a theoretical method to determine whether synchronized states in networks with delayed dynamics are stable against small disturbances.

Networks of interconnected oscillating units are able to achieve a common rhythm – a collective phenomenon known as synchronization. Examples include the simultaneous flashing of fireflies, neuronal activity patterns, or the stable operation of power grids. We investigate under which conditions such synchronous behavior is attained when the units react to their neighbors’ motion not instantaneously but with a delay due to information processing. Since such systems are mathematically challenging, the topic is still under active research.

What happens if we perturb one of the units slightly? Will all oscillators in the network eventually resynchronize despite their delayed reactions? To solve this problem, we mathematically derive exact stability conditions that tell us for which delay times the system will resynchronize and, conversely, at which delay times the disturbance will permanently break the synchronization. These results offer insight into how the critical delays depend on any network structure.

We apply our approach to two simplified models proposed to describe potential future energy systems. With the proliferation of renewable energy supply, it may become increasingly important to consider processing delays in the design and control of power grids. Additionally, the generality of our approach allows for application in various other contexts.
